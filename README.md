# Minigame Plugin Example

This plugin was initially created for a Job application and I was challenged to make it in two days. These two days also required me to complete four other tasks too
Since then I haven't thouched this repo. 

A config will need to be created for the map to have this plugin load correctly.
The idea is that any map could be used regarding it has a configuration and a portal as a kind of checkpoint
